                    <h2>What is Node.JS?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing back-end
                        JavaScript
                        code
                        outside
                        a web browser (means you don’t need to combine multiple languages to use JavaScript). It
                        simplifies
                        the way
                        websites are created and allows JavaScript run more efficiently and effectively and have
                        much
                        more
                        support.
                        Before NodeJS, there were no other real JavaScript alternatives, as it was more of a
                        server-side
                        language.
                        <br>

                        Ryan Dahl initially released NodeJS on the 27th of May 2009. The Node.js Foundation was
                        formed
                        in
                        2015 to
                        increase Node.js adoption and speed up development of the Node.js ecosystem. It was formed
                        as a
                        neutral
                        body, and used an ‘open governance model’ to increase participation in development. The
                        Technical
                        Steering
                        Committee (TSC) is the governing body of Node.js that handles technical issues, such as the
                        Node.js
                        codebase. The current managing group of Node.js is the OpenJS Foundation, which was formed
                        when
                        the
                        Node.js
                        Foundation and JS Foundation merged in 2019. <a href="#para1">+</a>

                    <h2>Node.JS Main Competition</h2>
                    <p>
                        The main competitors to Node.js are PHP (Laravel), Python (Django, Flask), Ruby, Java
                        (Spring),
                        .NET. One of
                        Node.js’s main advantage is that it uses JavaScript, developers familiar with frontend
                        development
                        do not
                        need to learn another language to develop server side. This, coupled with its easy set up
                        contributes to a
                        quick learning experience for developers. As Node.js is a relatively new technology, it does
                        not
                        have the
                        same level of support as other mature, trenched competitors such as Java (Spring) or PHP
                        (Laravel).
                        The
                        upside of this however, is that it has an increasingly high rate of growth and will continue
                        to
                        see
                        support
                        for many coming generations.<a href="#para3">+</a>

                    <h2>Node.JS Growth</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since it’s initial release in 2009, Node.js as a back-end Javascript runtime environment has
                        been a
                        huge hit
                        in sever-side development and is a global leader in frameworks. According to Stack
                        Overflow’s
                        Developer
                        Survey conducted in 2021, Node.js ranked 6th in programming, scripting, and markup languages
                        with
                        33.91%
                        from 83,000 responses. Comparing this result to previous years, Node.js has increased in
                        popularity
                        continuously. Node.js has a big future ahead. The momentum it has gained over the past few
                        years
                        has
                        caused
                        it to become the most popular JS language framework for new devs. IoT development using
                        Node.js
                        is a
                        major
                        reason behind the longevity of the framework due to countless new technologies being
                        released
                        each
                        year
                        requiring low server-side demands, minimal memory usage and flexibility. The growth and long
                        term
                        demand
                        trends seen for the framework will continue into the future as more developers learn and
                        implement
                        it into
                        applications, IoT and the cloud. <a href="#para2">+</a>
